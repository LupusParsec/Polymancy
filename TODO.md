THINGS TO FIX:
-

* Make Polymancy tab not bug when the command "/thaumcraft reload" is used;

* POLYMANCY, BLOODMAGIC, BOTANIA and EMBERS researches not unlocking;

* Fix some researches that don't complete when they should;
  - Botanurgist's Inkwell (I don't know when it's supposed to be unlocked yet)
  - Blood Rod (Whenever an Imbued Slate is crafted, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
  - Manasteel Caps
  - Terrasteel Caps
