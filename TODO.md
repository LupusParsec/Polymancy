THINGS TO FIX:
-

* Make Polymancy tab not bug when the command "/thaumcraft reload" is used;

* Fix some researches that don't complete when they should;
  - Discovering Polymancy (probably after completing the first Thaumaturgy research)
  - Discovering Ember (get the Ancient Codex)
  - Discovering Blood Magic (get the Sanguine Scentiem)
  - Discovering Botania (get the Lexica Botania)
  - Botanurgist's Inkwell (I don't know when it's supposed to be unlocked yet)
  - Blood Rod (Whenever an Imbued Slate is crafted, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
  - Manasteel Caps (Whenever an Manasteel Cap is crafted after throwing the inert one in a Mana Pool, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
  - Terrasteel Caps (?)
