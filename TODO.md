THINGS TO FIX:
-

* Make Polymancy tab doesn't bug when the command "/thaumcraft reload" is used;

* Fix some researches that don't complete when they should;
  - Discovering Polymancy (Probably unlocks after completing the first Thaumaturgy research)
  - Discovering Ember (Unlocks after getting the Ancient Codex. Discovering Polymancy must be unlocked first to this one become avalible)
  - Discovering Blood Magic (Unlocks after getting the Sanguine Scentiem. Discovering Polymancy must be unlocked first to this one become avalible)
  - Discovering Botania (Unlocks after getting the Lexica Botania. Discovering Polymancy must be unlocked first to this one become avalible)
  - Botanurgist's Inkwell (I don't know when it's supposed to be unlocked yet, but it doesn't matter when or how you get the inkwell, this one never completes)
  - Blood Rod (Whenever an Imbued Slate is crafted, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
  - Archaic Rod (Whenever a Wildfire Core is crafted, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
  - Manasteel Caps (Whenever an Manasteel Cap is crafted after throwing the inert one in a Mana Pool, the game doesn't consider this requirement as "completed")
